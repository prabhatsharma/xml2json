However, literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the absolute bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is about 40%.</paragraph>    <paragraph>After a single dose of three Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets USP to 17 women under fasting conditions, the extents of absorption of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol were 98.6% and 99.0%, respectively, relative to the same dose of the 2 drugs when given as a microcrystalline suspension in water. The effect of food on the bioavailability of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets USP following oral administration has not been evaluated.</paragraph>    <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol following daily administration of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets USP for 21 days per cycle for three cycles, were determined in 18 women. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol following single and multiple dose administration of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets USP are summarized in Table I. Mean levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol levels after a single dose and on day 21 at steady state are shown in Figure I.</paragraph>    <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of total levonorgestrel are non-linear due to an increase in binding to SHBG, which is attributed to increased SHBG levels that are induced by the daily administration of ethinyl estradiol. Increased binding of levonorgestrel to SHBG leads to decreased clearance of levonorgestrel.

These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is less than that associated with childbirth.</paragraph>    <paragraph>The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970&apos;s â but not reported until 1983. However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.</paragraph>    <paragraph>Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy nonsmoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.</paragraph>    <paragraph>Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy nonsmoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.

The dosage of Sronyx is one tablet daily for 21 consecutive days per menstrual cycle plus 7 peach inert tablets according to the prescribed schedule. It is recommended that Sronyx be taken at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime. During the first cycle of medication, the patient should be instructed to take one white Sronyx tablet daily and then 7 peach inert tablets for twenty-eight (28) consecutive days, beginning on day one (1) of her menstrual cycle. (The first day of menstruation is day one.) Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last white tablet. (If Sronyx is first taken later than the first day of the first menstrual cycle of medication or postpartum, contraceptive reliance should not be placed on Sronyx until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.)</paragraph>    <paragraph>When switching from another oral contraceptive, Sronyx should be started on the first day of bleeding following the last active tablet taken of the previous oral contraceptive. The patient begins her next and all subsequent 28-day courses of Sronyx on the same day of the week that she began her first course, following the same schedule. She begins taking her white tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last peach tablet, regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress.</paragraph>    <paragraph>Anytime a subsequent cycle of Sronyx is started later than the next day, the patient should be protected by another means of contraception until she has taken a tablet daily for seven consecutive days.</paragraph>    <paragraph>If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance, however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her physician. Although the occurrence of pregnancy is highly unlikely if Sronyx is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken before the medication is resumed. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing the contraceptive regimen.</paragraph>    <paragraph>    The risk of pregnancy increases with each active (white) tablet missed. For additional patient instructions regarding missed pills, see the    <linkHtml href="#miss1">&quot;WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS&quot; section in the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING</linkHtml>    below. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. If the patient misses one or more peach tablets, she is still protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking white tablets again on the proper day.  </paragraph>    <paragraph>    In the nonlactating mother, Sronyx may be initiated postpartum, for contraception. When the tablets are administered in the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered.

It does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.    </content>      </paragraph>    <paragraph>Oral contraceptives, also known as &quot;birth-control pills&quot; or &quot;the pill&quot;, are taken to prevent pregnancy, and when taken correctly, have a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used without missing any pills. The typical failure rate of large numbers of pill users is less than 3% per year when women who miss pills are included. For most women oral contraceptives are also free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.</paragraph>    <paragraph>For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be life-threatening or may cause temporary or permanent disability or death. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:</paragraph>    <list listType="unordered">        <item>smoke</item>        <item>have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol</item>        <item>have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice, or malignant or benign liver tumors.</item>      </list>    <paragraph>You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding.</paragraph>    <table width="100%">        <col width="100%" align="left" valign="top"/>        <tbody>            <tr>                <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule">                    <content styleCode="bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious adverse effects on the heart and blood vessels from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives should not smoke.</content>                  </td>              </tr>          </tbody>      </table>    <paragraph>Most side effects of the pill are not serious. The most common such effects are nausea, vomiting, bleeding between menstrual periods, weight gain, breast tenderness, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use.</paragraph>    <paragraph>The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and are young. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by the pill:</paragraph>    <list listType="ordered">        <item>Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack and angina pectoris) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes and subsequent serious medical consequences.</item>        <item>Liver tumors, which may rupture and cause severe bleeding. A possible but not definite association has been found with the pill and liver cancer. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer.</item>        <item>High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped.</item>      </list>    <paragraph>The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your doctor or healthcare provider if you notice any unusual physical disturbances while taking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, as well as some anticonvulsants and some antibiotics, may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness.</paragraph>    <paragraph>Studies to date of women taking the pill have not shown an increase in the incidence of cancer of the breast or cervix. There is, however, insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that pills may cause such cancers.</paragraph>    <paragraph>Taking the pill provides some important non-contraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, less menstrual blood loss and anemia, fewer pelvic infections, and fewer cancers of the ovary and the lining of the uterus.</paragraph>    <paragraph>Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare provider believes that it is appropriate to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient information booklet gives you further information which you should read and discuss with your healthcare provider.</paragraph>    <paragraph>        <content styleCode="bold">This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy.

contraception altogether.</td>              </tr>          </tfoot>        <tbody>            <tr>                <td>          Chance          <footnoteRef IDREF="f1"/>                  </td>

In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.</paragraph>    <paragraph>    If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your doctor about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby or a mid-trimester pregnancy termination. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill.

Any of these conditions can cause death or serious disability.</paragraph>    <paragraph>Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease.</paragraph>    <paragraph>3.GALLBLADDER DISEASE</paragraph>    <paragraph>Oral contraceptive users probably have a greater risk than nonusers of having gallbladder disease, although this risk may be related to pills containing high doses of estrogens.</paragraph>    <paragraph>4.LIVER TUMORS</paragraph>    <paragraph>ln rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. ln addition, a possible but not definite association has been found with the pill and liver cancers in two studies, in which a few women who developed these very rare cancers were found to have used oral contraceptives for long periods. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer.</paragraph>    <paragraph>5.CANCER OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS</paragraph>    <paragraph>There is, at present, no confirmed evidence that oral contraceptives increase the risk of cancer of the reproductive organs in human studies. Several studies have found no overall increase in the risk of developing breast cancer. However, women who use oral contraceptives and have a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules or abnormal mammograms should be closely followed by their doctors.</paragraph>    <paragraph>Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives.</paragraph>    <table width="75%">        <caption>TABLE V.

It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7-26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, except for those women over the age of 40, when the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group.</paragraph>    <paragraph>The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older high-dose pills and on less-selective use of pills than is practiced today. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy, non-smoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. However, all women, especially older women, are cautioned to use the lowest-dose pill that is effective.</paragraph>    <paragraph>        <content styleCode="bold">WARNING SIGNALS</content>      </paragraph>    <paragraph>If any of these adverse effects occur while you are taking oral contraceptives, call your doctor immediately:</paragraph>    <list listType="unordered">        <item>Sharp chest pain, coughing of blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung)</item>        <item>Pain in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg)</item>        <item>Crushing chest pain or heaviness in the chest (indicating a possible heart attack)</item>        <item>Sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, disturbances of vision or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke)</item>        <item>Sudden partial or complete loss of vision (indicating a possible clot in the eye)</item>        <item>Breast lumps (indicating possible breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast; ask your doctor or healthcare provider to show you how to examine your breasts)</item>        <item>Severe pain or tenderness in the stomach area (indicating a possibly ruptured liver tumor)</item>        <item>Difficulty in sleeping, weakness, lack of energy, fatigue, or change in mood (possibly indicating severe depression)</item>        <item>Jaundice or a yellowing of the skin or eyeballs, accompanied frequently by fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark-colored urine, or light-colored bowel movements (indicating possible liver problems)</item>      </list>    <paragraph>        <content styleCode="bold">SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES</content>      </paragraph>    <paragraph>1. VAGINAL BLEEDING</paragraph>    <paragraph>Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your doctor or healthcare provider.</paragraph>    <paragraph>2.CONTACT LENSES</paragraph>    <paragraph>If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.</paragraph>    <paragraph>3.FLUID RETENTION</paragraph>    <paragraph>Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.</paragraph>    <paragraph>4.MELASMA</paragraph>    <paragraph>A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.</paragraph>    <paragraph>5.OTHER SIDE EFFECTS</paragraph>    <paragraph>Other side effects may include change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, and vaginal infections.</paragraph>    <paragraph>If any of these side effects bother you, call your doctor or healthcare provider.</paragraph>    <paragraph>        <content styleCode="bold">GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</content>      </paragraph>    <paragraph>    1.    <content styleCode="italics">Missed periods and use of oral contraceptives before or during early pregnancy.</content>      </paragraph>    <paragraph>There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your healthcare provider before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, or if you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare provider immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Do not continue to take oral contraceptives until you are sure you are not pregnant, but continue to use another method of contraception.</paragraph>    <paragraph>There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives or any other drugs should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and prescribed by your doctor. You should check with your doctor about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.</paragraph>    <paragraph>    2.    <content styleCode="italics" ID="feeding">While Breast-Feeding</content>      </paragraph>    <paragraph>If you are breast-feeding, consult your doctor before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use oral contraceptives while breast-feeding. You should use another method of contraception since breast-feeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant, and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breastfeed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely.</paragraph>    <paragraph>    3.    <content styleCode="italics">Laboratory Tests</content>      </paragraph>    <paragraph>If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor you are taking birth-control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth-control pills.</paragraph>    <paragraph>    4.    <content styleCode="italics">Drug Interactions</content>      </paragraph>    <paragraph>Certain drugs may interact with birth-control pills to make them less effective in preventing pregnancy or cause an increase in breakthrough bleeding. Such drugs include rifampin, drugs used for epilepsy such as barbiturates (for example, phenobarbital) and phenytoin (Dilantin is one brand of this drug), phenylbutazone (Butazolidin is one brand) and possibly certain antibiotics. You may need to use an additional method of contraception during any cycle in which you take drugs that can make oral contraceptives less effective.</paragraph>    <paragraph>    5.    <content styleCode="italics">Sexually transmitted diseases</content>      </paragraph>    <paragraph>This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy.
